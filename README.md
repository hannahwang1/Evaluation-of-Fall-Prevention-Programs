# Evaluation-of-Injury-Prevention-Programs

## Datasets

Data was collected by Injury Preventions Programs from 2019 to 2021. Attendance
was documented at individual Tai Chi for Arthritis sessions. Additionally, participants’ demographic information
was collected including age, gender, education, and zip code. In terms of impact metrics, a tug
and chair stand test was performed at two different time points. Furthermore, a satisfaction
survey was given to participants, to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the program delivery
and effectiveness.

## Lessons Learned

•	Due to a significant amount of missing data, there were inconsistencies in the information
collected across program sites within the same year and across different years. The Stepping On
program consists of seven sessions of the course of seven weeks. To assess retention, participants
who attended 5 sessions or more are considered Completers; those who attended less than 5
sessions are Non-completers. Participants with missing attendance information were not included
in either category.
