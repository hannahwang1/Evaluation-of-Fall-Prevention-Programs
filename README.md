# Evaluation-of-Injury-Prevention-Programs

The main purpose of this project was to develop a trauma database to trace participants’ demographic information, program attendance, and survey response. Pre- and post-completion data were compared to assess the needs, trace participation process, and analyze the program impact. The additional purpose of the practicum project was to evaluate the effectiveness of the injury prevention program through comparing injury cases, self-perceived risk, self-reported health conditions, and body functions. 

## Datasets

Data was collected by Injury Preventions Programs from 2019 to 2021. Attendance
was documented at individual Tai Chi for Arthritis sessions. Additionally, participants’ demographic information
was collected including age, gender, education, and zip code. In terms of impact metrics, a tug
and chair stand test was performed at two different time points. Furthermore, a satisfaction
survey was given to participants, to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the program delivery
and effectiveness.
