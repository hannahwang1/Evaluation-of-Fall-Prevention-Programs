## Lessons Learned

â€¢	Due to a significant amount of missing data, there were inconsistencies in the information
collected across program sites within the same year and across different years. The Stepping On
program consists of seven sessions of the course of seven weeks. To assess retention, participants
who attended 5 sessions or more are considered Completers; those who attended less than 5
sessions are Non-completers. Participants with missing attendance information were not included
in either category.
