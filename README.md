# Evaluation of Injury Prevention Programs

While injury prevention programs were delivered with a wider reach through virtual sessions, it brought new challenges in streamlining data collection and evaluation. The main purpose of this project was to develop a trauma database to trace participants’ demographic information, program attendance, and survey response. Pre- and post-completion data were compared to assess the needs, trace participation process, and analyze the program impact. The additional purpose of the practicum project was to evaluate the effectiveness of the injury prevention program through comparing injury cases, self-perceived risk, self-reported health conditions, and body functions. 

## Datasets

Data was collected by Injury Preventions Programs from 2019 to 2021. Attendance
was documented at individual Tai Chi for Arthritis sessions. Additionally, participants’ demographic information
was collected including age, gender, education, and zip code. In terms of impact metrics, a tug
and chair stand test was performed at two different time points. Furthermore, a satisfaction
survey was given to participants, to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the program delivery
and effectiveness.

## Project Summary

•	Logistic regression models and paired t-test were employed to examine the association between the program completion rate and multiple predictor variables that demonstrated health outcomes.

•	Due to the large number of missing data and low survey response rate in the post-COVID data, findings on virtual sessions may not accurately reflect the program impact and may fail to determine the influence of pandemic on program participation. Results were not generalizable to the overall effectiveness of other prevention programs. 

•	While there will be limitations in the data analysis due to the large number of missing post surveys, findings of the study will be meaningful to improve the current program practice and suggest future interventions. 

•	The evaluation of the program impacts demonstrated fall prevention interventions have a positive influence on the participant’s overall health condition and fall-related outcomes. 

•	Enhanced data collection methods will help to better track program participation and support evidence-based practice in the future. 

•	As the delivery of virtual sessions is moving forward, more improvement on data collection and analysis methods can be made in order to enhance the current practice of fall prevention programs.
